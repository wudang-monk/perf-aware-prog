The function ~SimCommand~ which is supposed to take care of simulating a given command is doing work that we already have done previously in
other functions such as ~RegIMM_RegMem~. A better approach is probably to remove it an put all the functionality into the functions that
have already extracted the register and data. At the same time It would be best to split out the code inside those functions into code that
does the simulation and code that translated the binary instructions into assembly.
